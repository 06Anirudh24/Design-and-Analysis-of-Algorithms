# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
In this assignment, two famous algorithms have been implemented in object-oriented C++ without using any kind of library functions or STL classes.

### Problem - 1 
This problem involves a [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1675432) implementation where we've computed all the intersection points of a given set of line segments. Two data structures, namely event queue and status queue have been implemented from scratch for this purpose. 

### Problem - 2
Here, as an example of Dynamic Programming, the RNA secondary structure prediction problem has been solved.
